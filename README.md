# tunableOCLbenchmarks

Under development...

This is a tunable extension for PolyBench/ACC OpenCL benchmarks. The exetension is based on the PolyBench/ACC OpenCL benchmarks which are developped in University of Delaware https://github.com/cavazos-lab/PolyBench-ACC by Scott Grauer-Gray, William Killian, John Cavazos, Robert Searles and Lifan Xu. The extension is straight forward by merging the original work groups in different granulity to change the number of work groups in the working space.

Benchmarks that have been modified to tunalble version:

linear-algebra/kernels/

	3mm

	gemm

stencils/

	convolution-2d

	convolution-3d
